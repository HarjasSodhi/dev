DNS
    fullform - domain name server
    whenever we enter a url the browser goes to a domain name server to find the address of the html and then the server fetches it and loads the page


diiference between send and json-
    The res. send function sets the content type to text/Html which means that the client will now treat it as text. ... json function on the other handsets the content-type header to application/JSON so that the client treats the response string as a valid JSON object
    -)send already knows status code and datatype.json does not


status code :-
    defines the status of browser gets
        there are ranges of status code
            100- informational
            200- success
            300- redirectional
            400- user side error
            500- server side error

Server Methods
    get-get data
    POST-send data in server
    delete-delete data in server
    patch- data update

API
    application program interface
    layer betwwen DB and server
    acts as a contract

REST 
    set of Rules on which APIs can be made. Another Guideline System REST is SOAP.
        1)json data only
        2)stateless
        3)no matter the source,the responce for a particular request should be same
        4)routes should use nouns
        5)Don't Use Verbs in URLs.

middleWare- any function in the server side is called a middleware. we can use app.use() to execute something we want to execute irrespective of the route and we need to put next(); so the control can continue.

mongoDB-it is same as firebase but better in costing security and scalability and nested queries are easier to perform. it is noSql.

mongoose- a library which provides a layer of abstarction between node and mongo.

collection- group of similar data
doc- each entry in the collection
mongoose - object data moddelling abd binary JSON
ip adress whitelisting- it is same as cors enabled but for mongo Databases
add DB user
schema - blueprint of a doc in collection.
model - A Mongoose model is a wrapper on the Mongoose schema. A Mongoose schema defines the structure of the document, default values, validators, etc., whereas a Mongoose model provides an interface to the database for creating, querying, updating, deleting records, etc
module.exports=name/obj with names
res.status(400)-remember;

Helper Functions- you can create a different file for some functions and export them eg- https://github.com/goelabhishek694/pep_backend/commit/615a7622585ffb1f74b5499792164952bb84eaf7

JSON web token(JWT)-
    it is a token sent from front end to backeend.
    back end contains a secret encryption key wrt which the uid in payload is encrypted.(like in cryptoJS)
    it consists of-
        1)header-contains encryption algo
        2)payload-contains a non repeating unique id
        3)siganture-forms a id which secret key and uid using algo
    this token is sent along with data in all subsequent requests to backend and using the uid and and algo in the received token and the secret key present in backend,backend generates a new signature and verifies it with its own signature and acts accordingly.
    algo is sent too because the algo might change across servers in different servers.
    after logout jwt is destroyed

forgotPassword flow -
    1)ask for email
    2)send a token to the the email and store the same token against the same email in database
    3)route to reset pass page and ask for email and token again.
    4)match it and ask for new password and change the password in database
