<!-- Q- Even though all p tags have same font size but they appear with different sizes when viewed. Fix this so that they appear the same. Also write the reasoning behind it. -->

<!--  Ans   -->

<!-- em is relative unit .it makes the size of element by multiplying its value with the size of the parent elemnt for   eg- here the body is 40px and the resultant size would be 40 x 1.5 = 60px
  first span becomes 1.5 times of body(40px);
  then div becomes 1.5 times of span(60px);
  then p becomes 1.5 times of div(90px);

it can be fixed by making em 1 -----

span,div,p {
  font-size: 1em;
}
